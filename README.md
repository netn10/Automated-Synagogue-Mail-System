# Automated-Synagogue-Mail-System
Automated Synagogue Mail System - useful Python script for automating and educational purposes.

# Shalom!
The purpose of the program is to send e-mail reminders two weeks before the date of Memorial Day to the member of the synagogue with information on how to commemorate him.  
The software has only been released and is in beta version 1.0. It may contain bugs and changes.

# Importent Notes:
1. Do not distribute it for a fee.
2. I do not take responsibility for any damage caused by the Software, including sending "spam" messages.
3. In order to use the software properly, do not change the names and / or locations of the files...
4. ... Except two files with Hebrew Names (GitHub doesn't like Hebrew):  
  A. Shana Meuberet.csv to שנה מעוברת.csv  
  B. Shana Regila.csv to שנה רגילה.csv  
5. The "settings.json" file is intended to initialize the email from which the messages will be sent to the members, the email password and the time of sending:  
  A. The software only sends emails via Gmail's email address.  
  B. The password must be hidden in order to secure it. You can do this by right-click on the file and then "Hide File".  
  C. The sending time is written in "HH:MM" format.
